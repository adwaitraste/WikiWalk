## Wikipedia Article Project (WAP)

This is a project made for the Algorithm Analysis and Design Course in Monsoon '20.
WikiWalk is a game where the objective of the game is to go from one randomly assigned Wikipedia article to another via the links present in an article.
Via this project we hope to map the human psyche to better understand what a person thinks when presented with a piece of informaation.
We also want to create a platform where people can spend time going reading and understanding Wikipedia articles.
